Code used for generating the results for my MA4M4 project 'Investigating the Impact of Community Structure on the Spread of Disease'.

Many diseases spread through close contacts between individuals, meaning that understanding human contact networks is vital in understanding disease dynamics. In this paper, I model the spread of disease on a network using a stochastic SIR model. I examine the impact of clustering on average outbreak size by running simulations on random Watts-Strogatz graphs and the impact of community structure by running simulations on random graphs generated by the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi Stochastic Block Model. I find a strong inverse relationship between the global clustering coefficient, $C$, and the average outbreak size, especially for $\mathbf{C \geq 0.3}$. I also find that community structure has a significant effect on reducing average outbreak size, beyond increasing the clustering, for networks with moderate to high modularity ($\mathbf{\geq 0.3}$).
